# Advanced Linear Regression

Has Python code 
Has PDF file with all 4 QNAs

House Price prediction model using regularization 
Used Ridge and Lasso models with different metrics 

Well commented python notebook
Steps of involved in the project are 
Create a dataframe
Find correlation of predictors with response
Add or remove Nan values
Remove outliers 
Check Correlation again
Create new variables which give more correlation 
Fix skewness of features 
Make categorical to numerical changes
Split traina nd test
Train using Linear Regression, Lasso and Ridge
Evaluate using R2 and Rss, MSE metrics
Find top features using eli5 library
